            <strong>Process:</strong> To build this game, the primary focus was to implement the game's logic for toggling lights
            and determining when the player has won. A grid-based approach was used to represent the game board, and CSS grid layout 
            provided a simple way to display the squares.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Creative Choices:</strong> The design was enhanced using visually appealing colors, a gradient background, and hover effects 
            to make the game more engaging. The use of smooth transitions and responsive design ensures a better user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Challenges:</strong> The main challenge was ensuring that the initial game board was both random and solvable. This was 
            achieved by simulating random clicks on the board during initialization. Debugging issues related to winning condition 
            detection was also a critical part of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Insights:</strong> This project highlighted the importance of clean modular code, especially when separating logic (JavaScript) 
            from styling (CSS). Additionally, testing the game logic thoroughly was crucial to ensure the game behaved as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project was a fun and educational way to learn about game development, grid layouts, and interactive web design.
