         <p>The prominent aspects of technological progress include current technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 
            computer vision <sup>(CV)</sup>, and the <sub>Internet of Things</sub> (IoT) that apply to many sectors, particularly surveillance cameras, 
            which use facial recognition in real time to enhance security. In general, security robots are the most prominent 
            security systems that assist humans in dangerous jobs that humans cannot do. Herein, a low-cost robot prototype 
            running on Raspberry PI 4 model B is proposed for enhanced safety and smart security. This smart robot functions to 
            detect whether an intruder has come inside with the<small> help of IoT and face recognition technology</small>. 
            The broadcasting of photos can take place with the room control through IoT. The system utilizes a facial recognition 
            algorithm, <big>separating authorized persons from intruders</big>. The Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) 
            algorithm is employed in image processing to identify and classify people with an accuracy of 90%. The IoT will notify the 
            room control system if a stranger is detected. An interface is designed to control the robot, which is linked to Wi-Fi from a 
            far end. If the person is recognized as a known 
            person, then authorization is provided to them.</p>

            <h1 align="center">1.Introduction</h1>
            <p><mark>today's fast-changing technological world, the fusion of AI and robotics has transformed how security and safety are approached. 
                Facial recognition technology emerges as a standout innovation, offering real-time identification capabilities. When integrated 
                with robotics, it covers the way for delicate safety and security across various domains, especially in industrial and commercial 
                sectors. The potential of facial recognition robots as an advanced solution for strengthening safety protocols and implementing 
                intelligent security measures is discussed by merging advanced facial recognition with the agility and adaptability of robots.
                Organizations can achieve greater situational awareness, proactive threat detection, and swift response mechanisms .</mark></p>
                <p><u>A robot is a machine that has computer programming which is capable of performing an intricate series of tasks on its own. 
                    Modern industrial automation and monitoring systems heavily rely on robots. Robots have become more useful and have more 
                    applications as technology has advanced. When people and working robots collaborate, their jobs will become easier and less 
                    complex [3]. With computer technology and various vision devices, including cameras and 3D scans, it can recognize and process 
                    digital photographs of human faces. This strategy is applied to distinguish between strangers and regular folks. Facial recognition
                     technology has emerged as an interesting field of study for robotic systems, 
                    smart homes and cities, and security applications. </u></p>
                    <p>IoT has recently entered the surveillance space to improve security and provide personal safety. According to this idea, many 
                        real-world gadgets are linked to the internet globally to gather and share data automatically. The benefits of IoT include cost 
                        savings, quick operation, automation and control, and simple information access [5]. To improve the quality of surveillance robots 
                        and offer quick reaction systems, facial recognition and IoT are crucial. A low-cost mobile robot prototype is proposed in this 
                        research to provide more intelligent protection. The developed model can be employed in various applications and is simple to 
                        install. The Raspberry Pi 4, which offers a high-performance computer processor compared to older Pi models or other 
                        microcontrollers like the Arduino Uno/Mega, 
                        controls the intelligent security system. </p>

                        <p>Biometric identification and security surveillance are two sectors that heavily rely on face recognition technologies. 
                            Yet it's evident that mobile robots, such as humanoid robots or security surveillance robots, will finally need to transition 
                            from traditional fixed position to mobile environment recognition. 
                            This study therefore sought to evaluate facial recognition systems' performance in both stationary and mobile settings. </p>
                            <p><i>Face recognition technology was first utilized a few years ago for restricted personal identification. Since then, its usage 
                                in security has expanded to include preventing fraud, criminal activity, and terrorist attacks. Furthermore, facial recognition 
                                is utilized in marketing, advertising, health, and other fields in addition to determining a driver's level of fatigue and lowering
                                 the number of collisions on the road. Numerous techniques are created to provide the highest level of face recognition accuracy. 
                                The field has adopted the deep learning approach due to its remarkable computing speed and resultant surprising results. </i></p>
    <p>There are many previous approaches where the focus was important on providing security but not on the efficiency of the security 
        system. So, based on the previous approaches and drawbacks seen in them, and with the developing technologies present today, 
        the alternatives mentioned below could be added to the available modules to improve the system's efficiency. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The robot can be developed in such a way that it provides surveillance and security, which ensures a smarter way of providing security.</li>
        <li>A Raspberry Pi camera can detect and recognize humans based on facial features</li>
        <li>The goal of this system could be to create a facial recognition-based access control system that improves security and simplifies access control in a building or organization. </li>
        <li>Using a Raspberry Pi module reduces power consumption, makes it more power efficient, and saves costs.</li>
    </ol>
